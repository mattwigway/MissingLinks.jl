# The algorithm works like this:

# First, we identify pairs of nodes that are geographically within a short distance, but are at least
# a minimum distance away on the network

# Then, for each pair, we identify how much making this connection would increase the aggregate number
# of origin-weighted destinations (i.e. the sum across origins of the number of destinations accessible within
# a threshold distance). We do this in several steps:
#  1. Identify all origins within the threshold of the first node of the proposed new connection
#  2. For each origin:
#    a. generate distances to each destination via the new link by summing
#      - Distance from origin to link
#      - Length of link
#      - Distance from link to each destination
#    b. generate the shortest distance to each destination, by taking min(existing distances, distances via new link)
#    c. calculate the (weighted) access implied these distances
#    d. subtract the (weighted) access for this origin originally
#  3. Sum the weighted access deltas
#  4. Repeat with the second node of the new link
#  5. Sum the results. This is the contribution to access of this link.

Add y to x, but only if x is not already typemax (used to indicate unreachable). This assumes that
if x < typemax(typeof(T)), x + y < typemax(typeof(T)), which is generally reasonable as x and y are in meters
and anything we're adding is well less than 65km, unless it's unreachable, which should only be the case for
x (coming from the distance matrix). However, we do use a checked_add to throw an error if that assumption is violated.

If x == typemax(T), return x
