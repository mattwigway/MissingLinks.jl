    create_graph_weights(graph, geodata, weightcols, distance)

Using a graph and a spatial data frame, assign weights to graph nodes.

Each row in the spatial data frame should have a weight associated with it
(if they are all equivalent, the weight can be set to a column of ones). For each
row, all graph edges within `distance` of the geometry of that row will be identified
(the spatial data frame should be in the same projection as the network data used to
create the graph). An equal amount of weight will be assigned to the nodes at each end of
all identified edges. (In a corner, twice as much weight will be assigned to the node at the
corner, as it will receive weight from each of the links adjacent to the property. The effect
may be even more pronounced if the streets on the other side of the intersection from the row
are also within `distance`).

`weightcols` specifies which columns to use as weights. It must be a vector. Multiple weight columns
can be specified. The function will return an n x w matrix, where n is the number of nodes in the graph,
and w is the number of weightcols specified. This will contain the weight for each node for each weightcol.
